BUGS

Always load files in UTF-8 format, for some reason no non-standard
letters turn the DOS output to ANSI, Might need to find another way
to send and receive events from mpv rather then only sending through DOS
in Echo IPC. Perhaps MPVLib. Where is \.\\ anyhow??

Window controls are not being changed from within Hotkeys
These needed for the Progress/Volume bars,and the clipboard function.
For titlebar changing.

Might need another look at the launching button positioning routine.
Mostly works, in rare cases not 100%.

FEATURES

Playlist editor.
